## General info

```
The idea of this project comes from Frontendmentor.io (link below). I created this application to practice working with APIs, I used two APIs IP Geolocation API and Mapbox API which I combined with Leaflet JS library. The application after entering the ip address (or domain) makes a query to the first API in order to obtain the location data for the given IP, then after obtaining the appropriate data, the coordinates of the obtained location are passed to the second API which on their basis displays an appropriate map view.
